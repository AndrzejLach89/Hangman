# Hello!  
I have started coding because I needed certain tools for my band, which I could not find neither on 
Google Play nor on the Internet. It were simple apps (creating set lists for gigs and tagging and uploading 
records from rehersals), so I decided to learn Python and try create these apps myself.  
Later on, I started using my (poor ;) coding skills at work, creating custom scripts for AutoCad Plant 3D,
application for managing Plant 3D libraries in my department, and other various scripts and applications,
which help me in everyday life and make life easier.
The satisfaction from creating my own software pushed me to learn more, and code more. At the beginning 
of this year I have decided to start learning C#, and it gives me a lot of joy.
